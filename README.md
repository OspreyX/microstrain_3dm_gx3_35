microstrain_3dm_gx3_45
======================

Driver implementing MIP protocol communication. Please see its documentation on: http://ros.org/wiki/microstrain_3dm_gx3_45.

Added GX3-35 compatibility! Also made it work in ROS Groovy - unfortunately this ment loosing most of the NAV functions for GX3-45. Since I only have the GX-35 this however is no issue.
